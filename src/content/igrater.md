  On WWDC on Monday, June 3, Apple released many new technologies, including iOS 13, iPadOS, and more. However, the most interesting and intriguing thing Apple announced this year at WWDC is... a cheese grater. Yes, Apple released a cheese grater. Not only that, it starts at $6000 and analysts predict it could go easily into the ten thousands. Apple said that their new device is not for average eaters, or people who just *like* cheese. The new iGrater, as it is called, is for the connoisseur of cheese, the professionals, who want their cheese to be as amazing as possible. "The new iGrater is the culmination of years of work we have done in the science of cheese-grating," Tim Cook said at the WWDC conference. 

# How is the device?

  It is made with food-safe steel, and can cut cheese with the most precision of any cheese grater, according to Apple. The device can also be plugged into a monitor, but not as a computer. It can scan the type of cheese that is being grated into its system using 360-degree cameras, and determine the best types of wine and other foods to go with that cheese using cutting-edge (no pun intended) artificial intelligence trained on hundreds of thousands of cheese samples. It also allows you to get the food shipped straight to your door, right from the screen. Tim Cook showed a live demo at WWDC this year, and it seems to be working well. 

# What are the accessories?

  The device can be plugged into Apple's brand new monitor, which has a breakthrough 6K resolution and costs $5000. The iGrater works amazingly with this monitor, Apple says, as the holes on the back of the monitor can serve as a backup cheese grater as well. However, to stand it up, you need to buy Apple's Pro Display Stand, which costs an extra $1000, much to the dismay of many people watching.
