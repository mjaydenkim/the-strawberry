On May 29, 2019, Robert S. Mueller gave a public speech about the report he and his Counsel wrote on interference into the 2016 Presidential Election. This is the first and last time he's giving a speech about this report, because Mueller is retiring from the counsel and dissolving it.

### I'm Fed Up

"I'm fed up with being hacked by Russians. I'm just fed up," Mr. Mueller said in his speech on the morning of May 29. "While I was working on the Report, I checked my email and I noticed that I had gotten a digital recipt from Amazon. A man by the name of Sergey had bought 27 wide-screen 4k TVs and shipped them to a weird address in Russia." He said that the delivery instructions stated, "Stop investigating us, or we will buy 27 more." Due to his scaredness, Mr. Mueller was forced to release the Report before he could make a decision on whether President Trump committed a crime. The Russians were infuriated by the release of the Report, and bought 39 more TVs off of Mr. Mueller's account, much to his dismay.

"It's a real tragedy," Nancy Pelosi stated of the incident. "I would've loved to see Trump in trouble. All I can say is that I hope that Mr. Sergey and his affiliates are enjoying *The Office* on their 66 wide-screen 4k TVs."
