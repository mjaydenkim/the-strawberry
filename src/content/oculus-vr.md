Oculus has released brand-new and revolutionary technology, by the name of Oculus Actuality, that allows the user to live- quite literally- in VR. It doesn't require a headset or a computer of any sort. Instead, a chip is implanted into the middle of your forehead and wired up to both of your eyes. After this, you can literally live in VR. Do you want to switch back to the real world? Just double-tap your forehead, and the headset will shut down. It has been stated by Palmer Luckey, the founder of Oculus, that the system "marks a new revolution in computing when you don't need your phone or computer for anything."

# But is it safe?

Oculus has, many times, stated that their technology is safe-to-use. The surgery used to implant the technology is performed by the best doctors from the most reputable hospitals. We also asked them if it was safe to use their system in somewhat public areas, and they replied that their Guardian system was being moved to the Actuality, so that the system would tell you if you're going to hit someone while playing a game, for example. The technology has also been perfected and tested- including on animals, so Oculus says that the hardware is completely safe.

# How does it work?

The technology is all hidden inside of a tiny chip that is implanted into your forehead. This includes Oculus's proprietary operating system. It also implants 2 cameras on either side of your head to create 360-degree tracking, so you can truly play everywhere. The hardware also comes with 2 Oculus Touch controllers.

# How much does it cost?

The Oculus Actuality costs $300 by itself, however, if you want the surgery, it is $600. However, Oculus doesn't recommend putting in the Actuality without the help of a doctor, as it could be dangerous.
